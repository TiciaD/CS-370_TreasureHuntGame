# CS-370 Treasure Hunt Game
This repo contains a pathfinding AI model created with Python and Jupyter Notebook. An AI agent plays the role of a pirate on the hunt for treasure and it's competing against the human player hunting for the same treasure. I was given the code for the environment, experience replay, the model and implementation of the play game functionality. My main goal was to create the code for the Q-Training Algorithm given a base skeleton. 

Computer Scientists are problem-solvers first and foremost, it is their job to use technology and leverage the power of computers to solve problems in various industries and improve our daily lives. Because technology is important in so many different industries, the role of a computer scientist is crucial to innovating and improving efficiencies in each field. This is why it is important as a computer scientist to approach problems with an open-mindedness, seeking to understand the problem, doing proper research and designing an appropriate solution to not only solve the initial problem but make it easier to iterate and improve from there. This goes into the ethics of a computer scientist as they have a responsibility to the end user to secure their data, respect their privacy and be transparent about how their data is being used.
